=============

This HSHTMLImageRenderer-swift is a modern form of a previously created project written in Objective-C and using UIWebView.

Now that UIWebView has been permanently deprecated, that solution no longer works.

Unfortunately it was not as simple as swapping out UIWebView with WKWebView and hoping it would all work again.

So the approach is similar, in that we have to have a WKWebView in the UIWindow's hierarchy, buried at the back somewhere, and we use a serial OperationQueue and Operation objects to use this WKWebView to render HTML content.

There are a few tricks:
    - The WKWebView's html template has to have a min/max zoom scale of 1, otherwise the rendering could be an issue.
    - The one aspect of this rendering is clear; we need at a minimum a target width for the content.  As such, we take this 'hidden webview' and resize it to the target width, meaning any content rendered will be inside the frame at a zoom scale of 1.0, making it straightforward to extract images.
    - WKWebView is a bitch.  It was adding some top margin because I needed to add this line:
        `webview.scrollView.contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior = .never`
        - apparently it was adding that by default.  Grrr....
    - Once you have those in place, then the image can be dynamically generated and it fits the content based on the targetWidth.
    
Swift and Objective-C Interoperability

Here's a very useful resource for the considerations you should make:

Cocoapods - Podspecs
---------

Basically can use almost any guide for setting up your own private pod repo, then creating podspecs.  You may need to add the HSPodspecs to your local cocoapods installation.
    
New version?
    ->  Update that version in the podspec and in the framework version Info.plist.  Commit, push, add version number tag.
    -> Verify it's ok:  (Terminal) > pod spec lint HSHTMLImageRenderer.podspec
    -> Push to spec repo: (Terminal) -> pod repo push HSPodspecs HSHTMLImageRenderer.podspec
    -> (OR WITHOUT WARNINGS) -> pod repo push --allow-warnings HSPodspecs HSHTMLImageRenderer.podspec
